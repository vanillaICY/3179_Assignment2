Description
Tourism and Visitors in Australia â€“ Data Visualisation 2

Domain & What:
This project is tourism and visitor activity in Australia, with a particular focus on 
international arrivals, their distribution across states and territories, and the main 
purposes for which people travel. Tourism is chosen because it is both socially and 
economically significant to Australia, and it has experienced dramatic shifts in recent 
years due to pandemic and subsequent recovery. Some years before pandemic may be referred 
as well. The visualisation addresses the need for a clear and engaging way to understand who 
visits Australia, where they go, and how patterns have evolved over time. 

Why:
I choose to visualise tourism and visitor patterns in Australia because tourism is a vital 
part of the national economy and culture, yet its trends are not always easy for the public
to interpret from raw statistics. The sharp disruptions caused by pandemic and the ongoing 
recovery highlight the importance of understanding how visitor numbers, spending, and purposes 
of travel are changing. By mapping where tourists go, identifying who they are, and potentially 
showing why they visit, the visualisation makes complex datasets more accessible and allows 
viewers to see the role tourism plays in their states and communities.

Target Audience:
The intended audience is the average Australian viewer, who may not have specialist statistical
knowledge but is interested in seeing how tourism contributes to their local region and how 
Australia is perceived globally as a travel destination. This could include students, professionals, 
or policy-interested citizens who want insights into trends that affect the economy and cultural 
exchange.

How (idioms): 
The visualisation uses a combination of idioms selected for clarity and storytelling. A choropleth
map of Australia forms the centrepiece, showing the distribution of international visitors by 
state, allowing viewers to immediately see regional contrasts. Supporting the map, a bar chart 
displays the top ten source countries of visitors, making it easy to identify Australia's most 
important tourism markets. Some other charts show the distribution of visitor purposes, comparing 
categories such as holiday, business and education. To highlight temporal changes, line chart 
may used to show arrivals over time. Together, these idioms provide both spatial and temporal 
perspectives, enhancing insight.

Special features:
The visualisation include the integration of multiple datasets into a single web page, styled 
with CSS for readability and layout. The Vega-Lite JSON files are accessible in the repository,
and annotations are included to guide interpretation. Icons and colour schemes are carefully 
chosen to support clarity. By combining maps, histograms, and time series, the visualisation 
tells a coherent story: where tourists come from, where they go, why they visit.
