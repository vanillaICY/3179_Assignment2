          <h2>Where Do Visitors Go?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="highlightR">Unevenly</span> international visitors are
            spread across Australia. <br /><br />
            New South Wales leads with the
            <span class="highlightR">largest share</span>, reflecting Sydney’s
            role as the <span class="highlightR">main gateway</span>, while
            Queensland and Victoria also draw strong flows through their
            <span class="highlightB">natural icons</span> and
            <span class="highlightB">cultural appeal</span>. In contrast, other
            states capture only a modest share, reinforcing their niche role.
            <br /><br />
            This <span class="highlightR">imbalance</span> isn’t only about
            tourism -- it is infrastructure and global connections. Major
            airports and universities naturally pull arrivals toward the east
            coast. Yet smaller states’ distinct offerings—<span
              class="highlightB"
              >outback landscapes</span
            >
            or <span class="highlightB">wine regions</span>—still diversify
            Australia’s tourism image. <br /><br />
            Overall,
            <span class="highlightR">strong</span>
            <span class="highlightB">east-coast</span> concentration is shown
            with how geography and economy intersect of holiday choices to shape
            visitor flows.

            <h2>Tourism's Rollercoaster Ride</h2>
            <p>
              The pandemic hit Australia’s tourism hard, sending arrivals in
              2021–22 to record lows. Since then, numbers have
              <span class="highlightR">climbed back steadily</span> as borders
              reopened and the economy recovered. By 2024–25, visitor arrivals
              are much stronger, though still not quite at the pre-COVID peak
              seen in 2018–19.
              <br />
              <br />
              This shows both the <span class="highlightR">resilience</span> of
              the tourism sector and the ongoing influence of global events on
              travel flows. Overall, the trend suggests Australia is on a
              <span class="highlightR">solid recovery</span> path, but full
              normality may still take time.

            <p>
              Just like the state map showed for 2024–25, this longer view
              highlights how arrivals remain
              <span class="highlightR">heavily concentrated</span> in
              <span class="highlightB">New South Wales</span>,
              <span class="highlightB">Queensland</span>, and
              <span class="highlightB">Victoria</span> across the years.
              <br />
              <br />
              While the pandemic caused a dip, the overall distribution barely
              shifted—these states
              <span class="highlightR">consistently dominate</span> because of
              their airports, business hubs, and attractions. The smaller states
              keep a steady but modest share, reinforcing the pattern we saw on
              the map: tourism in Australia is growing again, but its heart
              still lies on the <span class="highlightB">east coast</span>.

          <h2>Who Comes to Australia and Why</h2>
          <p>
            Australia’s tourism is shaped by both where visitors come from and
            what brings them here.
            <br /><br />
            The <span class="highlightR">top source countries</span> are mostly
            in <span class="highlightB">Asia</span> and
            <span class="highlightB">Europe</span>, reflecting strong regional
            ties and long-haul connections. <br /><br />
            <span class="highlightB">Holidaymaking</span> remains the
            <span class="highlightR">single biggest</span> driver of arrivals,
            but visiting friends and relatives has grown steadily over recent
            years, highlighting Australia’s diverse migrant links. Business,
            education, and conferences play smaller but consistent roles.
            <br /><br />
            Together, these charts show that while leisure dominates, tourism is
            <span class="highlightR">deeply connected</span> to Australia’s
            <span class="highlightB">international relationships</span> and
            <span class="highlightB">cultural networks</span>, making it more
            than just holidays—it’s also about family, study, and global
            exchange.

          <h2>Changing Balance</h2>
          <p>
            Tourism patterns reveal not just where people come from and why, but
            also who is travelling.
            <br /><br />
            Over the past decade, a
            <span class="highlightR">clear shift</span> has emerged. In 2014–15,
            female arrivals
            <span class="highlightR">slightly overtook</span> males for the
            <span class="highlightR">first time</span>, reversing a long history
            of male dominance in short-term visits. By 2024–25 the gap has
            widened, with over
            <span class="highlightB">4.4 million female</span> visitors compared
            to just under <span class="highlightB">4 million males</span>. This
            trend shows women increasingly driving international travel to
            Australia, reflecting broader changes in global mobility,
            independence, and travel preferences. <br /><br />
            Overall, the data suggests a
            <span class="highlightR">long-term rebalancing</span> of
            demographics, with female travellers now playing a leading role in
            shaping Australia’s tourism industry.

          <h2>Spending Tells the Story</h2>
          <p>
            The stacked bar chart of tourism consumption highlights the
            financial side of Australia’s visitor economy.
            <br /><br />
            Spending <span class="highlightR">dropped sharply</span> in
            <span class="highlightB">2020–21</span> as international travel
            collapsed, with only domestic tourism keeping the sector afloat.
            Since then, both domestic and international consumption have
            <span class="highlightR">rebounded strongly</span>, reaching nearly
            <span class="highlightB">$200 billion</span> in 2023–24.
            <br /><br />This shows not just recovery but a
            <span class="highlightR">renewed confidence</span> in travel, with
            Australians and overseas visitors alike contributing to the
            industry’s growth.

          <h2>Overall Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Looking across all charts, Australia’s tourism story is one of
            <span class="highlightR">disruption</span>,
            <span class="highlightR">resilience</span>, and
            <span class="highlightR">transformation</span>. <br /><br />
            Visitor arrivals fell dramatically during the pandemic but are
            steadily climbing back, with female travellers now leading
            short-term visits.
            <br />
            East coast states remain the dominant destinations, though niche
            markets continue to add diversity. Most arrivals come from Asia and
            Europe, with purposes split between holidays, family visits, and
            education.
            <br /><br />
            The recovery is also evident in spending, as both domestic and
            international tourists inject billions into the economy. Overall,
            the data shows that while pre-COVID peaks remain unmatched,
            Australia’s tourism sector has adapted and is on a
            <span class="highlightB">strong path forward</span>.
